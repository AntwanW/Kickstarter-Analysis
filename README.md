# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

-	Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart

	o Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared regarding their launch dates and funding goals.

-	Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart

	o Visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. 
	o use a new function, COUNTIFS ()

-	Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md)

### Purpose 

	- The Kickstarter Challenge was to build on the knowledge and skill we learned in the modules 	on excel. It was broken down into three deliverables. The goal of this project is to 		analyze the success and failure of fundraising campaigns for various theaters and 		plays.

## Analysis and Challenges

### 1) Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	- Very successful during April and May, started to decline in June and July and continued to 	decline until September. There were cancelations during September and November but an 		increase in failures.

### 2) Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	
	- The percentage on successful and failed mirrored each other, with a 0% of canceled, so it 	is also clear that playing campaigns with higher goals has a higher chance of failing. 		However, there is also an anomaly where the failure rate increases dramatically between 	$44,000 and $46,000.

### 3) Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-	Deliverable 1:

	* Challenges and Difficulties: On Mac, when pulling data into the Rows under PivotTable 	Fields, it will include Data Created, Year, and Quarter. Removing the Year and Quarter game 	me the information needed.

-	Deliverable 2:

	* Challenges and Difficulties: Using the new function COUNTIFS (). Data will be altered if it 	is not input correctly. Identifying how to complete the percentage and entering the formula 	correctly.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	-During April and May, expect an increase in success. 	
	-During September through December, expect failed or canceled.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	
	-The percentage of successful and failed mirrored each other. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	-Missing data
	-Lack of reliable data such as self-reported

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 

	-Outcomes based on Launch Date: Clustered Bar and Column.
	-Outcomes based on Goals: Clustered Bar and Column, Stacked Column.
